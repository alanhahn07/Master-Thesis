# Repository for my Master's Thesis
## Some data collection and analysis of the distribution of Champion Primes for non-CM Elliptic Curves

You may find my master's thesis in this repository. Note that the majority of the code was written in [sage](https://www.sagemath.org/) using Jupyter notebooks. Sage is a computer algebra systems written mostly in python, and has lots of math specific functionality. In particular, sage has functionality for working with [elliptic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve), which can be found [here](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/arithmetic_curves/index.html). The majority of the data analysis work was done in [minitab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minitab).
